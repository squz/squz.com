  <h1>Your World – Support</h1>
  <p>Thank you for using <strong>Your World</strong> by Squz! This page includes answers to common questions and helpful tips.</p>

  <h2>🧭 I can’t place countries correctly – what should I do?</h2>
  <p>Try zooming and rotating the globe to get a clearer view. Use pinch-zoom and swipe gestures to explore the map before placing countries or landmarks.</p>

  <h2>🌍 How do I unlock all countries and features?</h2>
  <p>To access the full game, including all 270+ countries, capital cities, and landmarks, simply tap the “Upgrade” button in the app. It’s a one-time in-app purchase.</p>

  <h2>📱 Why does the game need access to Game Center?</h2>
  <p>Game Center is optional and only used for leaderboards and achievements. If you prefer not to use it, you can still enjoy the full app experience.</p>

  <h2>👦 Is this app safe for children?</h2>
  <p>Yes! Your World is family-friendly and designed to be fun and educational for all ages, including children under 13. No personal information is collected.</p>

  <h2>🛠 App isn’t working as expected?</h2>
  <p>Try the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Close and reopen the app</li>
    <li>Ensure your iOS version is up to date</li>
    <li>Restart your device</li>
    <li>Reinstall the app if issues persist</li>
  </ul>
